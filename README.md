# G15_B_P1

This is the software repository for a team project of a multi-functional Arduino robot. The robot has 3 main functionalities/modes, which can be switched at any time using a DIP switch attached to the Arduino.
The functions are as follows:
1. Obstacle avoidance mode - robot moves forward until it detects an obstacle, at which point it turns to avoid it.
2. Line tracking mode - robot follows a dark coloured line on the ground.
3. Remote control mode - robot can be controlled with bluetooth using a processing interface. Controls are in classic WASD format and also has support for a leap motion controller with gesture/hand control.
